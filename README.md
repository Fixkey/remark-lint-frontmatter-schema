# Demo

# Usage

See [./demo](./demo/) folder to get a working, pre-configured, bare project workspace.  
You also get example markdown files and associated schema to play with.

Checkout the **[demo/README.md](demo/README.md) for step-by-step instructions**.

# Known limitations

Actually, you will not have code range detection for detected problems.  
Finding a way of doing this would allow hot-fix replacement for `enum` suggestions, for example.  
The great folks who made [yaml-language-server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server)
have tackled this.
