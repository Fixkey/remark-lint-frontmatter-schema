# Demo

[![Demo screenshot of frontmatter schema linter](./docs/screenshot.png)](./docs/screenshot.png)

# Usage

## Installation

```shell
pnpm i -D @julian_cataldo/remark-lint-frontmatter-schema
```

> **Remove** `-D` flag if you're using this plugin within a runtime **`unified`** MD / MDX **pipeline** (Custom, Astro, Gatsby, etc.), for production.  
> **Keep it** if you just want to lint with **CLI** or your **IDE** locally, without any production / CI needs.

## Setting up

### Markdown content

See **[./demo/content](./demo/content)** files for examples.

All you have to do is to point to a schema path, relative to project root, thanks to `'$schema'` key:

```markdown
---
'$schema': /content/creative-work.schema.yaml

title: Hello there
category: Book
---

# You're welcome!

â€¦
```

`creative-work.schema.yaml`

```yaml
type: object
properties:
  title:
    type: string
# ...
```

### CLI / IDE (VS Code)

```sh
pnpm remark .
```

Supporting `remark-cli` or `unifiedjs.vscode-remark` extension.

ðŸ‘‰Â Â **See [./demo](./demo/)** folder to get a working, pre-configured, bare project workspace.  
You also get example markdown files and associated schema to play with.

ðŸ“ŒÂ Â Checkout the **[demo/README.md](./demo) for step-by-step instructions**.

### MD / MDX pipeline

Use it as usual like any remark plugin inside your framework or your custom `unified` pipeline.

#### Custom

```ts
// ...
import remarkFrontmatter from 'remark-frontmatter';
import rlFmSchema from '@julian_cataldo/remark-lint-frontmatter-schema';

// ...
unified()
  //...
  .use(remarkFrontmatter)
  .use(rlFmSchema);
// ...
```

#### Framework

> **Warning**  
> NOT tested yet!

##### Astro

In `astro.config.mjs`

```ts
// ...
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  remarkPlugins: [
    // ...
    'remark-frontmatter',
    '@julian_cataldo/remark-lint-frontmatter-schema',
    // ...
  ];
  // ...
});
```

##### Gatsby

In `gatsby-config.js`

```ts
{
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // ...
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-transformer-remark',
      options: {
        plugins: [
          // ...
          'remark-frontmatter',
          '@julian_cataldo/remark-lint-frontmatter-schema',
          // ...
        ],
      },
    },
    // ...
  ];
}
```

# Known limitations

Actually, you will not have **code range detection** for schemas errors.  
Finding a way of doing this would easily allow hot-fix replacement for `enum` suggestions, for example.  
The great folks who made [yaml-language-server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server)
have tackled this, and much more.  
In fact, this remark plugin is **very far** from `yaml-language-server` capabilities, which are astonishing.  
Still, this `remark` plugin is, I think, the only way to validate YAML
frontmatter inside Markdown.  
My current knowledge is that YAML in Markdown, by not being part of any official specs, is hindering development in this direction.  
So it's better than nothing I guess, and could be a first step for something more robust.
